# Network

Here I wrote my own door Opener at V1 and server.
It continues with V2 with a simple but bugy Interface library and V3 with the MineOS GUI interface that perfectly works but working on it.

Why I stopped working on V2?
After finishing with writting and rebooting the Tablet it shows randomly stuff. 
The half was normal and the other half disappeard.
After rebooting it, it inverted but stayed after more reboots.
One Shade of Gray is somehow light blue... I mean WTF!?

V3  Its coming guys!
